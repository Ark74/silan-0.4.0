Description: commandline tool to detect silence in audio-files
 Silan is a standalone application to analyze audio files for
 silence and print ranges of detected signals.
 .
 It supports a variety of audio-formats and codecs by making
 use of libsndfile  and ffmpeg/libav for reading audio-data.
 .
 Signal threshold and hold-off time can be freely configured.
 The output can be formatted with samples or seconds as unit
 or printed as audacity label file.
